# HotVolume - Windows Deployment Guide

## 🎯 What You Have

I've successfully created **HotVolume**, a complete Windows desktop application that allows you to control individual application volumes using global hotkeys. This is exactly what you requested - the ability to reduce Spotify volume while playing CS2 with a simple key press.

## 📋 Quick Start (Windows Only)

### Method 1: Automated Installation
1. Copy all files to your Windows computer
2. Double-click `install_windows.bat` to install dependencies
3. Double-click `start_hotvolume.bat` to run the application

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on Windows
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project folder
3. Run: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python run_hotvolume.py`

## 🎮 How to Use

### System Tray
- Look for the HotVolume icon in your Windows system tray
- Right-click for quick volume controls and configuration

### Default Hotkeys (Ready to Use)
| Hotkey | App | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+F1` | Spotify | Volume Down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F2` | Spotify | Volume Up |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F3` | Spotify | Toggle Mute |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F4` | Chrome | Volume Down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F5` | Chrome | Volume Up |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F6` | Chrome | Toggle Mute |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F7` | Discord | Volume Down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F8` | Discord | Volume Up |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F9` | Discord | Toggle Mute |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F10` | CS2 | Volume Down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F11` | CS2 | Volume Up |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F12` | CS2 | Toggle Mute |

### Example Usage
1. Start playing music on Spotify
2. Launch CS2 or any game
3. While in-game, press `Ctrl+Shift+F1` to reduce Spotify volume
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F2` to increase Spotify volume
5. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F3` to mute/unmute Spotify

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adding Custom Hotkeys
1. Right-click the system tray icon
2. Select "Configure Hotkeys"
3. Add new hotkey combinations for any application
4. Set custom volume step sizes

### Supported Applications
HotVolume works with **any Windows application** that produces audio:
- **Music**: Spotify, YouTube, VLC, iTunes, Windows Media Player
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Communication**: Discord, Teams, Zoom, Skype
- **Games**: Steam games, CS2, any game with audio
- **And many more...**

## ❓ Why Can't It Run Here?

This application is specifically designed for **Windows only** because it uses:
- Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI) for volume control
- Windows COM objects for system integration
- Windows-specific process management

The current environment is Linux-based, so the Windows APIs aren't available. This is completely normal and expected.

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Copy the entire project folder** to your Windows computer
2. **Run the installation script** or install dependencies manually
3. **Start the application** and look for the system tray icon
4. **Test the default hotkeys** with Spotify and CS2
5. **Configure custom hotkeys** if needed

## 💡 Tips

- The application runs in the background via system tray
- Hotkeys work globally (in any application)
- Right-click the tray icon for quick access
- Use the configuration GUI to add more applications
- The app automatically detects running audio applications

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues on Windows:
1. Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
2. Run `python run_hotvolume.py --test` for diagnostics
3. Check that target applications (Spotify, etc.) are running and playing audio
4. Try different hotkey combinations if conflicts exist
